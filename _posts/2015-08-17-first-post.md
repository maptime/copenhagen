Welcome to the Copenhagen Maptime chapter, Denmark's first!

Maptime was an idea that came to life at the 2013 State of the Map US conference with the underlying premise to get more people involved with OpenStreetMap (OSM). Maptime Copenhagen aims to bring this idea to Denmark and introduce new to mapping in a fun, open environment. We will be holding events at exciting locations in Greater Copenhagen using Mapillary and other tools to gather detailed information on the selected area. 

Whether you are a dedicated OSM contributor with thousands of edits under your belt, a Mapillary champion or brand new to the world of mapping, all are welcome. Stay tuned...more from us soon!
