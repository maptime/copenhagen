Mapillary in cooperation with OpenStreetMap Denmark and Wikipedia Denmark will be meeting in Sagnlandet on the *th of September Denmark's first Maptime. Sagnlandet, known as the Land of Legends in English, is an easy 45 minute drive from Copenhagen and a popular place to explore Denmark's anthropological history. The site contains reconstructions of vilages and structures from the Iron Age, Stone Age and Viking periods.

We will be using Mapillary to map the village, taking extensive sequences throughout Sagnlandet which will then be reconstructed in Mapillary allowing people to explore from their home. Both OSM and Wikipedia editors will then be able to use this information to add point of interest information and make more detailed notes on articles related to Saglandet.

If you love mapping, taking photos and or history, sign up for the event and we look forward to mapping with you on *th September.
